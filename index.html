            <p>Hello I am a student. But I need to learn some skill so that i don't fall in trouble in long run of my
                life.
                That's why i am learning coding. You can also tell it's my passion. I always find attraction in digital
                thing. I also have been a profetional esports athlete . But in our country every one take this as a
                taboo.
                Hope one day it will change. Everyone will take this as a sport sector like other sport. But most of all
                it's not secured. Like player don't get enough sallary </p>
